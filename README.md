# Project-Analysis-I

This repository contains project analysis documentation that was produced as my team's coursework project
within **CTU FEE B6B36ZSO â€“ Introduction to Project Management** university course.    
Documentation shown here contains detailed project vision of the future realization of the university's internal
web platform by a student team. This analysis describes and justifies the future project from the viewpoints of the classic project
management triangle and, despite being written primarily in plain text, includes popular approaches like SWOT, WBS, Gantt temporal chart, etc.  
The business case itself is imitative and holds no intent of the actual realization of the platform. The platform is called QuizHub and is
meant to host quizes on the requested university courses and other interactive tools, expanding and complementing available studying material
on the courses that tend to lack it, transforming it to a more practically "exercisable" shape, and thus increasing the overall results and students' engagement to study at CTU FEE.  
Per B6B36ZSO requirements, the analysis is written from the perspective of a student team that has noticed the problem, come up with an idea of the platform, and is required to make a structured presentation of the project of the platform's realization to the appropriate department of the administration of CTU FEE to gain the neccessary resourses and authorization.


By the end of the first half of this coursework project my team assigned me the role of team leader. The reasons for that were, presumably, that I cared the most, had the highest awareness and left the most comments on other people's work among the other members of our team. As a result, it was my extra responsibility:
- to assure the quality of the submitted work;
- to distribute tasks among the team members;
- to gain more detailed requirements from our group's tutor;
- to explain how the valid final form would have to look like and to help people achieve it on their parts;
- to communicate and to make things work in our international team.


It has been a pretty vivid three-month experience that, I would say, has made me even more enthusiastic about IT project management and project analysis.
